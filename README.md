# Mobile-Wearable-Application #
This is an opinion poll application. Its purpose is to allow users the ability to vote on specific topics that are important where they live. 
A user will be shown topics people in their postcode are interested in. when a user creates an account they will also be given the option to pick any 
topic as their main topic of interest. 

# Introduction #
#The aim is to design and create a localised opinion poll application for Android platforms. 
#Users can contribute towards opinion polls every day/week by answering How much they agree or disagree with questions but only in their postcode.
#A user can view the general opinions of people living in their postcode. 
#User progress on completing poll questions will be saved so they can complete them later.
#The application will use location privileges to verify postcodes.
